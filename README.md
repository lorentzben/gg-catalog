# gg-catalog
## Author: Ben Lorentz

This repository is a place to hold code and tables for a process that is attempting to generate a catalog that describes:

    - Which taxa are present in each gut segement (Duodenum, Illium, Jejunum, Ceca)
    - Genes present from the taxa present in each segment
    - Metabolites present in each segment

Data will be collected from:

- Long Read Data [Zhang et. al. 2022](ftp://ftp.agis.org.cn/âˆ¼fanwei/Chicken_gut_metagenome_Hifi/.) 

    - [paper citation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9673493/)

- Short Read Data [Huang et. al. 2018](ftp://ftp.agis.org.cn/~fanwei/Chicken_gut_metagenome) 

    - [paper citation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6260706/)
